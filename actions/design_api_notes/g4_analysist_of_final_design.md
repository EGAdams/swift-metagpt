# Utilizing `WriteDesign` for Software System Development

The `WriteDesign` class acts as a bridge to leverage the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) for software design. Here's a breakdown of how it can be used in the context of building a software system that aids in the development of other software systems:

## 1. **User Requirements**:
The user provides requirements in the form of a Product Requirement Document (PRD). This document should offer a clear understanding of the desired system, its functionalities, and any other specifications.

## 2. **Prompt Generation**:
Using the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` and `FORMAT_EXAMPLE`, a comprehensive prompt is created. This prompt not only sets the context but also guides the LLM on the expected format and content for the software design.

## 3. **Interacting with the LLM**:
The `run` method of `WriteDesign` sends the generated prompt to the LLM. The LLM, in turn, processes this prompt and responds with a detailed software design. This design encompasses:
- Implementation approach
- Package name
- Essential files
- Data structures and interface definitions
- Program call flow
- Areas of uncertainty or confusion

## 4. **Workspace Creation**:
A new workspace is created (or an existing one is recreated) to store the generated software design. This workspace has a structured directory layout with separate folders for documentation (`docs`) and resources (`resources`).

## 5. **Saving the Design**:
The provided PRD and the generated software design are saved into their respective locations within the workspace. Additionally, any mermaid charts are processed and saved as visual resources.

## 6. **Review and Refinement**:
The user can then review the generated software design. If there are areas marked as "UNCLEAR", the user can provide further instructions or clarifications. Iterative interactions with the LLM can be performed until a satisfactory design is achieved.

## 7. **Code Generation (Potential Future Step)**:
While the current `WriteDesign` class focuses on software design, a potential future step could involve another class or method that takes this design and generates actual code. By providing a detailed program call flow and data structure definitions, the LLM can be guided to generate functional code snippets or even entire modules.

## Conclusion:

The `WriteDesign` class offers a streamlined approach to harness the capabilities of an LLM for automated software design. By clearly defining the requirements and guiding the LLM through structured prompts, it's possible to generate detailed and practical software designs. This can significantly accelerate the software development process and ensure a consistent structure and format across different projects.
