# Swift-Based Format Example

## Swift Dependencies
Dependencies for Swift are defined using the Swift Package Manager. Here's an example format:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourPackageName",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/some/repo.git", from: "1.0.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "YourTargetName", dependencies: ["DependencyName"]),
    ]
)
```

## Other Language Dependencies
If your Swift project relies on non-Swift libraries or frameworks, you can specify them in this section. For instance, you might include C libraries:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourPackageName",
    products: [
        .library(name: "YourLibrary", targets: ["YourTarget"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [],
    targets: [
        .systemLibrary(
            name: "CLibraryName",
            pkgConfig: "clib",
            providers: [
                .brew(["clib"]),
                .apt(["clib-dev"]),
            ]
        ),
        .target(name: "YourTargetName", dependencies: ["CLibraryName"]),
    ]
)
```

## API Specifications
While Swift doesn't natively support OpenAPI, you can still specify your API using OpenAPI 3.0:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
...
description: A JSON object representing the Swift-based API specifications.
```

## Logic Analysis
Detail the logic components by file, and their purpose or content:

```swift
let logicComponents: [(fileName: String, description: String)] = [
    ("GaugeController.swift", "Contains core airplane gauge logic and controllers."),
]
```

## Task Prioritization
List the Swift files in order of their development priority:

```swift
let taskOrder: [String] = [
    "Config.swift",
    "AirplaneTestController.swift",
    "Main.swift",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge Base
Provide insights or explanations about shared utilities, frameworks, or modules in Swift:

```
'Utilities.swift' contains shared methods and extensions used across different modules. Make sure to initialize the 'AppConfig' from 'Config.swift' at the start.
```

## Clarifications Needed
Highlight any areas that need further instructions or clarifications:

```
Ensure that the 'Main.swift' file initializes all necessary configurations and sets up the airplane gauge test session.
```
