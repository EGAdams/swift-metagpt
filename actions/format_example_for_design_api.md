## Implementation approach
- We are going to use the following sutable open source tools ...
- The challenges posed by the requirements are ...

## Swift package name
```python
"airport_gauge_test"
```

## File list
```swift
[
    "main.swift",
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Speedometer{
        +int speed
    }
    
    TestReport "1" -- "1" ListOfTests: has
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    G->>M: start airport gauge test
    M->>G: initailize menus
    M->>G: run test
    M->>G: write test report
    G->>M: end test
```
